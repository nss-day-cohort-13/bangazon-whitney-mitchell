# Requirements

1. A full test suite with full coverage of all methods
2. User data will be stored in a text file and should contain at minimum
  - A user ID number
  - Screen name
  - Full name
3. Chirps will be stored in a text file and should contain at minimum
  - A chirp ID number
  - Who authored the chirp
  - Is this a public or private chirp
  - Who the chirp is to (if applicable)
  - The text content of the chirp

### Challenge
[Serialize](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/pickle.html) the user and chirp data before storage & deserialize on read.

## How to get started

1. Tests first!
1. You can use `input()` and `print()` to show prompts and read user input.
1. You know how to use [`open()`, `readline()` and `write()`](https://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files) to maniuplate data in text files.
1. You'll use with [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/csv.html) files for data storage. All you need to do is read the contents of the file, then split the values on the commas.
1. You can write conditional logic with `if`

Start with the basics

1. Show the main menu and read the user's choice with an `input()`.
1. Based on the user's choice, `print()` their choice, i.e. "You chose to make a new chirp."
1. Create the logic for each of the conditions to recieve further user input & display other menus.
1. Once all user input is received, perform the appropriate file action (reading from or writing to the chirps file), and direct the user back to the appropriate menu.
